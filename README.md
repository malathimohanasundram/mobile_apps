# Mobile Application Programming
This course is designed to give students a foundation on the development of applications for mobile devices. It will cover the workflows, tools and frameworks required to develop applications for current and emerging mobile computing devices. The course will adopt a current technology as a basis for teaching the process of mobile application development. This course will also expose the students to composing user interfaces for mobile, integrating with backends and the software architecture for the mobile application and the backends. At the end of the course, students should be able to work collaboratively in developing working data-centric mobile applications.
